        <h2> Versioning Your API </h2>

<p>The <i>servant</i> package contains everything needed to describe an API,
and little else. In particular, we decided to keep <i>servant-server</i> as a
separate package. This enables an easy and effective way of versioning your
API that avails itself of familiar tools - Hackage and cabal - in what we
think is a novel way.
</p>

<p> The basic idea is that, when writing a service, you can keep your API as a
separate package, containing only the type that (with the servant combinator)
describers your API, and the types that your endpoints accept (via query
parameters, captures, or request bodies) and return.</p>

<pre>
<code class="haskell">
-- The entire contents of your API package
module MyAPI where

import Servant

type MyAPI = "date" :> Get Date
        :<|> "time" :> Capture "tz" Timezone :> Get Time

data Date = ...
data Timezone = ...
data Time = ...
</code>
</pre>

<p>This package is a perfect
encapsulation of your service's <i>interface</i> - everything that's needed to
interact with it, but nothing of the internals. You can upload it to Hackage
without exposing code that should only be private.</p>

<p> Your server can then depend on the package. Other users (possibly within
your company) can write packages that interact with that API simply by
importing (a) <i>servant-client</i> and (b) your API package. They ought not
place version bounds on your API package, however, for reasons that might
already be clear. </p>

<p> In essence, any change to the <i>code</i> (i.e., not comments or
documentation) of your API package will constitute a change to your <i>API</i>,
and as such indicates that client code <i>may</i> break. If it does break, a
build from scratch (such as you get from travis) will <i>automatically</i>
indicate this, since assumptions about your API will be reflected as type-level
incompatibilities with the latest Hackage version of your package.</p>

<p> In this manner, you can develop both server and client code in a way that
feels natural, without much overhead, and <i>guarantee</i> that API changes are
safe. You can't update your server in a way that necessitates an API change
without change your API package version. And you can't write client code that
relies on an API other than the one deployed, unless you develop against stale
versions. (The only exception is the always-tricky case of an endpoint whose name
and types don't change, but whose behavior does in ways the client may not
expect. Such changes should, in any service, be avoided as much as possible.)
This assumes there are no version bound placed in your API package - otherwise,
there's no guarantee that server and client agree on the interface.<p>
